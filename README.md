# 👋 Hi, I'm Marios Sardis

I'm a protein biochemist/cell biologist and assay development expert with over a decade of experience in cell and molecular biology, protein engineering, and mechanistic studies.
I specialize in building R&D platforms from the ground up, translating complex biological questions into actionable experiments that drive innovation.

At the bench, I work extensively with mammalian and bacterial cell cultures, protein expression in mammalian and bacterial systems, protein purification, and developing biochemical 
and biophysical assays to study protein-ligand interactions and mechanisms of action. I’ve also contributed to patents and publications in therapeutic innovation and microbiological quality control.

Beyond biology, I also develop tools for color analysis and shade classification of historical collectibles, combining scientific rigor with cultural preservation.


## 💻 Why I'm Learning to Code

### 🔬 Protein Biochemistry & Structure Prediction
I'm expanding into computational biology to:
Automate data analysis and screening workflows
Model protein structures and interactions using platforms like HADDOCK, iTASSER, and OpenFold
Apply AI and LLM-based tools to support drug discovery
Integrate bioinformatics pipelines with wet-lab experimental data
Build interactive visualization tools for mechanistic interpretation

### 🎨 Color Shade Analysis of Collectibles
I'm also building Python-based tools to:
Digitize and classify collectible artifacts like stamps and medals
Perform calibrated color extraction and shade comparison
Develop algorithms for color-based authentication and cataloging
Combine image processing with historical metadata analysis for research and digital archiving

## 🛠️ Tools I'm Exploring
Python • OpenCV • RDKit • Rosetta • HADDOCK • PyMOL scripting • Conda/WSL environments • LLMs for research acceleration
Color analysis tools: Pillow • scikit-image • LAB/XYZ color conversion • NumPy-based shade analysis • Visualization pipelines

## 🌱 Always learning more about:
Antibody design • Structural bioinformatics • Scientific visualization • AI for life sciences
Color science for collectibles • Algorithmic classification • Historical research through digital imaging
